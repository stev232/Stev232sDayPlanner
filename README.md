# Stev232sDayPlanner

## Description

This project will use DayJS to set the current day and help determine the current time. The user will input their own schedule based off of a time table that starts at 9AM and ends at 5PM (17:00). The data that the user enters will be saved in local storage to keep it as a personal day planner.

## Acceptance Criteria

*WHEN I view the time blocks for that day*<br>

*WHEN I click into a time block*<br>
__THEN__ I can enter an event<br>
